# Hematopoietic_TF_RegulatoryNetwrork
I came across this paper, "Transcriptional regulatory logic orchestrating lymphoid and myeloid cell fate decisions" by Godini et.al. published this year in Frontiers in Immunology (https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1544483/full). I am interested in the genetic circuitry that governs hematopoietic stem cell fate decisions and very much like to explore this topic.   To make a story short, authors analyzed two publically available datasets (```GSE109125 for GEX and GSE100738 for ATAC```) by using a R pacakge, ```weighted gene co-expression network analysis``` created by Peter Langfelder and  Steve Horvath, which has been widely used to analyze phenotypic correlates of hihgly co-expressed genes and visulaize interactions of coexpressed genes  between distinct phenotypes through a web, more precisely network of coexpressed genes.  
There are some serious issues associated with the use of WGCNA for the co-expression analysis.  I would point these out during my review of the data analysis done in Gondini et.al.
